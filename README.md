# Learning_Python
I taught myself python thanks to Zed Shaw's book, "Learn Python the Hard Way". These are my answers to the exercises. This was with Python 2.7

I had started using Atom and TextEdit as editors, switching between the two depending on the exercise for some time. I've found that I like using nano in the terminal on MacOS a little better. Every alphanumeric character must be entered in and there's no select or autocomplete. It's really a matter of personal preference. 

I comment most things at this point, but if there are questions, comments, or helpful/constructive feedback to improve the code, please let me know. :) Open to learning opportunities! :)

Thanks much!
